# RISC-V ISA extensions for AI

This repository contains a collection of Dockerfiles that can be used to run simulations of ISA extensions for the [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) processor, specifically those targeting AI acceleration.

This project was developed as a part of the [A-IQ Ready](https://www.aiqready.eu/) project under [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/).
